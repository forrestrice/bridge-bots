nt|jlall: bob might just open 2@S here r/w|pg||
nt|bbramley: not a fan|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|jlall: i like stansbys X|pg||
nt|bbramley: three hearts will deter some people|pg||
nt|jlall: at the 1 or 2 level you should overcall your 5 card suit, but at a higher level it's better to keep everything in play|pg||
nt|jlall: imo|pg||
nt|bbramley: i agree|pg||
mb|3D|an|with values|mb|p|nt|jlall: by everything in play I mean, clubs, diamonds, or a penalty pass from partner|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jlall: stansby is not showign a massive hand here, because martel showed values with his 3@D bid|pg||
nt|bbramley: clear 3@H call after partner shows values|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jlall: with a bad hand he would have bid 2N, lebensohl|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: 3N looks like a make|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jlall: since you can shut hamman out|pg||
nt|bbramley: lucky make when spades go 7-2 instead of 6-3, AND east has all of the other relevant high cards|pg||
nt|jlall: well|pg||
nt|jlall: if spades are 7-2, then hamman probably has nothing else|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: E-W std carding and leads, obvious shift|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bbramley: the lead (when north has the 9) and east's failure to raise both suggest the 7-2 split|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and smith echo, high from either side says likes the suit|pg||
nt|mildredb: Meckwell are playing 4@D, after they got Xd in 3NT|pg||
nt|jlall: hi mildred|pg||
nt|mildredb: hi, everyone :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: if i were playing all four positions the contract would be 5@D:  3@S-P-4@S-DBL-P-5@D|pg||
nt|jlall: full disclosure... all commentators here are texan so bob hamman is our god ;)|pg||
nt|bbramley: hi mildred|pg||
nt|bbramley: as well as my boss|pg||
nt|jlall: wow bart, if it went 3S X 4S X p i would pass and lead my stiff heart and expect to get a huge number|pg||
nt|jlall: no wonder you bid so much, you dont X yourself :P|pg||
nt|jlall: it was a good double by steve in the other room, i wonder if he did it to get them to run|pg||
nt|bbramley: this time you would, but next time south will have VOID-KQxxx-KQxx-Axxx and west will be void in diamonds|pg||
nt|jlall: weinstein is very successful/famous in the poker world, so whenever he Xs a 3N and they run and it's cold I think he played poker|pg||
nt|bbramley: it's a good ploy to double 3NT when you have no idea if they can make it|pg||
nt|bbramley: if they sit you hope to beat it, and if they run to 4 of a minor you'll be happy regardless|pg||
nt|jlall: yes i agree, it ups the stakes tremendously for them and only a little bit for you|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hamman still thinking|pg||
nt|bbramley: i'm a little surprised that meck ran - he plays a little poker himself|pg||
nt|jlall: hamman knows its right to shift since he has no entry to his suit, unfortunately it looks like there is no promising shift|pg||
nt|jlall: sometimes in this situation its right to just set up your suit as a bluff like you have an entry, but here it is futile|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes - every shift helps declarer - even a diamond creates an extra entry in diamonds|pg||

nt|gavin:  i dont think he was ever considering playing @S the other way, just whether to cash the A first|pg||
nt|bbramley: and even with @SQ it's still a ratty overcall w/no aces, a bad suit, a passed partner and wrong vulnerability|pg||

nt|bbramley: we're all saying the same thing|pg||

nt|jlall: yes i agree|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2H|mb|3S|nt|gavin:  yes he has a trump trick with QJx , but any time partner has 2 trumps or the king of spades he will be able to get him back in for a 2nd ruff|pg||
nt|gavin:  and it doesnt cost to take his trump trick now or later|pg||
nt|mildredb: and he might get 2|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mildredb: take his ruff, cash @SA & pard will tell him what to do|pg||
nt|caitlin: X|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|gavin:  he already will have with his @H return, but yes its easy from there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  he will play a high @H indicating he doesnt want another @D ruff|pg||
nt|jlall: 4@D is not a slam try, it is just to help partner judge what to do if the opps bid 4@S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jlall: also NS play weak NT, so north's 2H showed abotu a strong NT with 4 hearts|pg||

nt|gavin:  he needs to trump dummies spades and cant get there enough|pg||

Indonesians Franky Karwur and Denny Sacul, recent winners of
the IOC Grand Prix in Lausanne and Rhodes Olympiad finalists
in 1996, are mainstays of their  consistent national team. True
gentlemen at and away from the table, they focus on partnership
and error-free bridge. 51 VP out of first, they need a win here
to stay in the hunt. Their opponents, Wubbo de Boer and Bauke
Muller of Holland, Bermuda Bowl champs in 1993, are a further
24 behind . Our first deal, a partscore, is played successfully
in diamonds at every table but one (Auken/von Arnim fail in 3C).
Karwur/Sacul achieve par [datum is N/S minus 110] at 3D. However,
getting there is half the fun, as the old Greyhound Bus adverts
used to boast. Muller\\'s (probably necessary) balanced takeout
double is hardly a classic, and de Boer shows no mercy, bidding
both his majors on very slender values. Sacul (1D showed 2+ cards)
saves the day by converting 3C to 3D, expecting 2/3 in dummy
on the auction. Muller leads a challenging low heart but Sacul
puts up the king: plus 110. {Your host for this match, John Carruthers}
